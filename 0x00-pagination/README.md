## What is pagination 
Pagination is a technique used in user interfaces, especially in web applications and content-heavy websites, to divide large amounts of data or content into smaller, more manageable chunks or pages. The purpose of pagination is to enhance user experience by reducing the load time and improving navigation through the content.

In the context of web pages, pagination usually involves breaking up long lists of items, search results, or articles into separate pages. Instead of showing all items at once, users can view a specific number of items per page and navigate through the content using page numbers or navigation arrows. Common examples of paginated content include search result pages, blog archives, comments sections, and product listings on e-commerce websites.
