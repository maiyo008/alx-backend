# 0x03-queuing_system_in_js
In JavaScript, a queueing system, often referred to as a message queue or task queue, is a mechanism for managing and executing asynchronous tasks or messages in a specific order. It helps in organizing and processing tasks in a way that ensures proper sequencing, concurrency control, and often, distributed communication between different parts of an application or system.
